<p>Google Search (also known simply as Google or Google.com) is a search engine provided and operated by Google. Handling more than 3.5 billion searches per day,[3] it has a 92% share of the global search engine market.[4] It is the most-visited website in the world. Additionally, it is the most searched and used search engine in the entire world.<br><br>

The order of search results returned by Google is based, in part, on a priority rank system called "PageRank". Google Search also provides many different options for customized searches, using symbols to include, exclude, specify or require certain search behavior, and offers specialized interactive experiences, such as flight status and package tracking, weather forecasts, currency, unit, and time conversions, word definitions, and more.<br><br>

The main purpose of Google Search is to search for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers, as opposed to other data, such as images or data contained in databases. It was originally developed in 1996 by Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Scott Hassan.[5][6][7] In 2011, Google introduced "Google Voice Search" to search for spoken, rather than typed, words.[8] In 2012, Google introduced a semantic search feature named Knowledge Graph.</p><hr><hr>
